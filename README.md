## Usage

### Compiling and Running Solutions

#### C++ Example

To compile a C++ solution (for example, the Two Sum problem):

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -o solution 001_Two_Sum.cpp
./solution
```
```bash
g++ 001_Two_Sum.cpp
./a.exe
```

#### Java Example

To compile and run a Java solution (for example, the Two Sum problem):

```bash
javac 001_Two_Sum.java
java 001_Two_Sum
```

Feel free to adapt the commands based on your system configuration and project structure.
